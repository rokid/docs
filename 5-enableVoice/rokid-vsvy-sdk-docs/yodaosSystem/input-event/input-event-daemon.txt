INPUT-EVENT-DAEMON(8)
=====================


NAME
----
input-event-daemon - input event handling daemon


SYNOPSIS
--------
[verse]
*input-event-daemon* [ [ --monitor | --list | --help | --version ] |
                     [--config=FILE] [--verbose] [--no-daemon] ]


DESCRIPTION
-----------
input-event-daemon(1) is a daemon which executes a user-defined command on
input events, such as keys, mouse buttons and switches. This can be useful
to handle special keys on laptops or multimedia keyboards without X11.


OPTIONS
-------
*-m, --monitor*::
    Start in monitoring mode. In this mode 'input-event-daemon' does not detach
    to background, but shows every input event and the device file which
    triggered it.  This option is to be specified exclusively.

*-l, --list*::
    Lists all available input device files, including their name, supported
    features and physical path.  This option is to be specified exclusively.

*-c, --config*='FILE'::
    Use configuration file 'FILE'. This option will be ignored in monitoring
    mode. See below for syntax information.
    (default: '/etc/input-event-daemon.conf')

*-v, --verbose*::
    Verbosely print every event which is handled in the configuration file.
    This option may be combined with the option *--no-daemon*.

*-D, --no-daemon*::
    Do not detach from console.


*-h, --help*::
    Print help and quit.

*-V, --version*::
    Print program version number and quit.


FILES
-----
'/etc/input-event-daemon.conf'::
    The default path of the configuration file.

EXAMPLES
--------
A common configuration file may look like this:
----------------
#
# /etc/input-event-daemon.conf
#

[Global]
listen = /dev/input/event0
listen = /dev/input/event1

[Keys]
MUTE         = amixer -q set Master mute
CTRL+ALT+ESC = shutdown -h now

[Switches]
RADIO:0 = ifconfig wlan0 down

[Idle]
1h 30m = vbetool dpms off
reset  = vbetool dpms on
----------------

*[Global]*::
Specifies all devices files to listen to. This option may be used more than
once.

*[Keys]*::
All commands in this section are executed when the specified shortcut occurred.
Modifiers are separated by the plus sign. A shortcut may be defined only once.

*[Switches]*::
This section defines commands which are executed when a specified switch is set
to the defined value. Switch name and value are separated by a colon.

*[Idle]*::
The commands defined in this section are executed after all input devices did
not send any events in the specified amount of time. The special key 'RESET'
is triggered when returning from idle.

NOTE: The idle time applies to all events, even such not handled by
input-event-daemon (e.g. mouse movement).


INSTALLATION
------------
To build and install input-event-daemon from source use the following commands:
----------------
$ make
$ make install
----------------

KNOWN BUGS
----------
Since the device file paths do change when devices are added or removed, you
may want to use *udev(7)* to automatically create a symlink for the device.

A custom udev rule which creates '/dev/input/usb-mouse' may look like this:
----------------
SUBSYSTEM=="input" ATTRS{name}=="USB Optical Mouse" SYMLINK+="input/usb-mouse"
----------------
